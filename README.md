Stock Price Predictor & Real Estate Price Predictor
Overview
This project contains two predictive models:

Stock Price Predictor: A model to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
Real Estate Price Predictor: A model to estimate real estate prices based on various property features and market conditions.
Both models utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze trends and make predictions. The goal is to provide useful tools for financial analysis and property valuation.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or LSTMs (for time-series forecasting in stock prices).
Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface to input data and receive predictions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization), TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional for deep learning models)
